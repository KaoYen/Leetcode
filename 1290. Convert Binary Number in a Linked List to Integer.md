# Description

>Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number. 
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

Example 1:
```py
Input: head = [1, 0, 1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

Example 2:
```py
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
```

Example 3:
```py
Input: head = [1]
Output: 1
```

Example 4:
```py
Input: head = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 18880
```

Example 5:
```py
Input: head = [0, 0]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:
- The Linked List is not empty.
- Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
- Each node's value is either 0 or 1.


# soluation:
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        # 計算head的長度
        length = 0
        copy_head = head
        while copy_head:
            length += 1
            copy_head = copy_head.next
        
        total = 0
        while head:
            total = total + head.val * 2**(length - 1)
            length = length -1
            head = head.next
        return total
```
